# PokemonClassification
<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>
Image classification is a task within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves categorizing images into specific classes or categories.

“Pokémon” a popular Anime (Japanese Cartoon) that is centered around fictional creatures called "Pokémons”, features many unique characters, each with unique visual characteristics. In our project, we used three Pokémon characters Pikachu, Bulbasaur & Charmander, and developed an image classification system that identifies them using the KNN algorithm or model.

The dataset is carefully chosen, and various steps including collecting data, preparing it through preprocessing, extracting significant features, and developing a model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, aim to capture the unique characteristics of Pokémon characters. The KNN algorithm is utilized to calculate similarity and predict labels based on the closest matches.


The project seeks to address the challenge of accurately identifying Pokémon characters from images and contribute to the field of computer vision by exploring methodologies for image classification. The ultimate goal is to create a system that can be applied to real-world applications involving Pokémon character recognition and potentially extending the techniques to similar domains.
